- my computer player will choose the best movement, i.e. the movement achieving the most flipping tiles.
- I'll create a dictionary to store all the possible movements positions (row, col) as the keys for the
computer player, and store the steps (the number of flipping tiles) and the opposite directions as items.
When it comes to play, the computer player will compare all the steps and choose the best one, and apply
the movement accordingly.
- similar to the step II, the next move depends on which movement can flip the most tiles.
- the ai_player loses pretty often
- makes the weighing of corner piece more, so when the numbers of flipping tiles are same, ai_player should
put the tile more towards the corner, since the edge tiles are unflippable
